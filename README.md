# metro-greatmaps

This is a redesign of a WPF which showcases the greatmaps control.
The awesome [Metro WPF controls](http://mahapps.com/) are used.

# A list of changes from the original:
..* Message pop-up for traffic simulation is redesigned.
..* All options are categorized to appropriate Flyouts.
..* GMap control now takes the whole screen, with search bar and zoom buttons hovering above,
..* providing a cleaner experience.
..*"Margin hell" is relatively solved, and minimal margin usage is applied.

# Things I wish to do:
..* Code cleanup
..* Minimize number of unneeded projects
..* Rewrite the project by using the MVVM pattern
